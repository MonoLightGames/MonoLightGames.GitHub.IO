		<p>Dear partners,</p>
		<p>Three years ago today, we naively founded MonoLight Games to develop games we love.</p>
		<p>
			Similar to many small and medium size teams in Turkey, we ended up having lots of blockers.<br />
			At that point, we decided to become an enabler and empower others to plan, build and grow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since then, we had many opportunities to work with some of the best industry professionals.<br />
			We generously shared our network with partners to find best fit talents for their projects.<br />
			We supported a few promising ideas by advising with our existing know-how and expertise.<br />
			We accepted bunch of exciting challenges and delivered the best possible solutions in time.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a small team of 7 like-minded individuals, it was an unforgettable experience so far.<br />
			Today, we believe mobile game development industry in Turkey is thriving like never before.<br />
			We are honored to be a part of it and very proud of our positive impact.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can never thank you all enough for your vision and trust.<br />
			It is extremely hard for us to say goodbye but, it's time to change.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sincerely,<br />
			MonoLight Games Team
